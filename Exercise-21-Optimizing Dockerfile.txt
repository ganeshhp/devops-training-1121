Optimizing Dockerfile

1) regularly audit your container images. Validate if a functionality added earlier is still necessary.

2) In the Dockerfile, avoid remote connection in the build stage. SO instead of using ADD use COPY instruction to copy a file from local drive/folder and avoid copying from network resource.

3) avoid stating the image tag / version as "latest" as it can lead to any incorrect image selection as well. Suggest a particular version available for the base image.

4) Avoid using root user inside Image creation and container.

5) create a non-root user.
   $ RUN useradd -m appuser
6) switch to the non-root user
   $ USER appuser
7) Set working directory for the application where the user has full access.
   $ WORKDIR /home/appuser
8) Copy application file to the user home directory to which user has full access
   $ COPY . .
9) Run the application as non-root user
   $ CMD ["./myapp"]
